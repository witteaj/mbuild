    "# Tutorial for Git-Flavored Version Control\n",
    " \n",
    "This tutorial will serve as a general guide for using **Git** with the **fork-join** model, which is a very common git-based version control methodology.\n",
    " \n",
    "This is also the version control system (VCS) we employ with our suite of [mosdef](https://github.com/mosdef-hub) based software. Becoming familiar with this method will be useful for many future collaborative projects you work on in your academic and professional careers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Contained below will be a general tutorial for learning the basics of git, github, fork-join, and setting up your own mosdef related repositories!\n",
    " \n",
    "## Make a GitHub Account\n",
    "If you have not already done so, go ahead and make an account on [github.com](https://github.com).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Try Git and Learn the Basics\n",
    "[This link](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) will walk you through some of the basics of git and github.\n",
    " \n",
    "You do **not** need a Code School account, just follow through the tutorial and this will get you started with the basic commands.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Fork-Join Model\n",
    " \n",
    "Now that you have your feet wet with the beginner commands for git, let's look a bit deeper into the fork-join model.\n",
    " \n",
    "Follow [this link](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for a brief introduction and visualization.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### To Summarize:\n",
    "* The master (upstream) branch is the main branch that is in production.\n",
    "    * Only commits that have been accepted by the administrative team for that project will be merged into the master branch.\n",
    "    * These commits usually pass some form of review by the administrators and error checking as well.\n",
    "* To contribute to a project, you create a copy you can edit on github. **--forking--**\n",
    "* Then, you can make a copy of that on your work machine to edit and push changes to your forked copy. **--cloning--**\n",
    "* When you feel you have a suitable change to submit for review, you submit your proposal back to the original code base. **--pull request--**\n",
    "* Once approved, the code will be merged into the production branch (upstream). **--joining--**\n",
    " \n",
    "## Hello, World!\n",
    "The de facto standard in tutorials and introductions for any computer science related project is always the \"_Hello, World!_\" example. This is also the case with this tutorial too!\n",
    " \n",
    "[Hello, World!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)\n",
    " \n",
    "This will step you through:\n",
    "* Making a repository\n",
    "* Committing to said repository\n",
    "* **Creating a branch.** **_VERY IMPORTANT_**\n",
    "* `README` file editing\n",
    "* Merging a pull request\n",
    " \n",
    "These are all very useful skills you will need this summer and in the future!\n",
    " \n",
    "## Forking\n",
    "So, now that we have all this information, how do we actually use it?\n",
    " \n",
    "Lets look through [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) tutorial on forking on github.com.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "# Final Thoughts\n",
    " \n",
    "Now you should be somewhat familiar with the git workflow and how to use the fork-join model.\n",
    " \n",
    "I encourage you not to rely on the GUI git systems, as you might run into the situation where you must remotely connect to the computer in question to make and commit edits. Which will be more of a challenge to use a graphical interface compared to the command line.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Last Example\n",
    "Finally, to test these skills you just learned, complete the list below:\n",
    "1. Fork and clone [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild).\n",
    "    * I recommend when you clone this to your machine, you put it in a place where you can find it easily.\n",
    "       * For example, I put all my projects like this in a `builds/` directory\n",
    "2. Set your fork on github as your `Origin`\n",
    "3. Set the [mosdef-hub/mbuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) repo as the master remote repo.\n",
    " \n",
    "That should be enough git for today!\n",
    " \n",
    "Listed below are excellent links for learning more about git and some nice cheat sheets as well!\n",
